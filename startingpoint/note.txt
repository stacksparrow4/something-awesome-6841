Hi, welcome to my server!
I'm Hamish and I have a few friends around here, namely James, Randal, Tom, and Daniel.
They have each been setting up their websites nearby, you should check them out!
James: http://stacksparrow4.xyz:9001/
Randal: http://stacksparrow4.xyz:9002/
Tom: http://stacksparrow4.xyz:9003/

Daniel seems quite secretive, but it looks like he did give me sudo permission to run something on this machine. Maybe you should check it out?

Side note: You can get my friends to visit urls on their websites like follows:
giverandalurl.sh http://stacksparrow4.xyz:9002/somepage
givetomurl.sh http://stacksparrow4.xyz:9003/somepage

James doesn't like visiting his site.
