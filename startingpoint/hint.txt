Hi, my name is Daniel (linux username "daniel") and I have a secret.
There is a machine that is hidden on this internal network that is called "finale".
I have a user on that machine, but I won't tell you the password!

If you want to steal my stuff, you'll need to find my 3 favourite words!
And no-one knows them except my 3 best friends! My password is the following:

favword1_favword2_favword3_8204723
